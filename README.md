## Competitions ü•á
- **[Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/sebperre/advent-of-code-2024):** Completed all 50 stars for advent of code in Python. I had lots of fun and learnt many problem solving techniques along the way.
- **[UVEC Programming Competition 2024](https://github.com/cowpod/maff):** My three teammates and I spent 6 hours creating a math game to help educate children. We created a fully fledge frontend and backend, created documentation, implemented leaderboards and presented a slideshow.
- **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Competition 2024:** In a four-person team and an exciting six-hour session we developed a min-max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning AI for Ultimate Tic Tac which competed against other teams AI. We collaborated closely, debugging and building a competitive bot. After the competition, I found and fixed several bugs, further improving the bot's performance to make it better.                   

## Volunteering and Research üß™
- **Research Volunteer Position:** Primary focus was on detecting bias in LLMs. Used ChatGPT's API, Cohere API, BGE M3's Flag Model, and Microsoft E5 to gather LLM embeddings to perform analysis on. Used the top 100k words in the English language to perform analysis on the bias of these words using SC-WEATs primarily on gender and race. Calculated an effect size to see how prevalent the bias is in these words. Used big tech words to see how they correlate between gender and expanded functions to take different types of words and categories. Generated various charts (effect size, lexicons, etc.) and graphs (t-SNEs, frequency bar charts, clustering charts, etc.) denoting bias such as effect size. 

## Professional Goals üöÄ
- **Career Development:** Focused on getting a job in Software Development or Finance and hopefully both.
- **Continuous Learning:** Always learning new technologies to leverage my skills in the Tech Industry. Click [here](https://github.com/sebperre/continuous-learning) to view some certificates I have and what I'm currently learning.

## Awards ü•á
- **2023-2024 Dean's List Student**: Dean's list for the 2023-2024 year for having a top 10% GPA in the faculty of Science.
- **2020 UVic Entrance Scholarship**: $3000 entrance scholarship for the University of Victoria.
